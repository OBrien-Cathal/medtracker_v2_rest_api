## Developer notes
### Ongoing Development
The majority of currently unimplemented features mentioned in this document are supported by the current object model,
except patient registration with a practitioner.

### DB Filling
On startup of the application two sources of initial data may be loaded
- On an empty DB the data.sql file will fill some basic bootstrapping data
- If there are less than two medications in the DB (this rule is totally arbitrary), then extra data will be loaded from the files located
  - ``` 
      src/main/resources/InitialDataFiles
      ```
